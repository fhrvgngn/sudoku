This Chrome extension is a Proof of Concept to solve the daily Mini-Sudoku game on LinkedIn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When activated, the script checks for the game URL (https://linkedin.com/games/mini-sudoku).
The code retrieves the game grid using a selector for the grid cells and, using a low‑tech backtracking solver, the script solves the puzzle.
The user can click on "Show Solution" and the complete Sudoku solution is rendered.
By clicking on the highlighted numbers in the solution, the numbers will be filled in the game grid.

Use responsibly — do not skew the global stats with unrealistic results!
